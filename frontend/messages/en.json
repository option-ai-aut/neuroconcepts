      "q1": "Can I try Immivo for free?",
      "a1": "Yes! You get a full trial week — completely free and without a credit card. During this time you have access to all basic features, including CRM, emails, calendar and properties. Jarvis (AI assistant) and the Image Studio have limited availability during the trial. After 7 days, your account is automatically paused — no charges unless you choose a plan.",
      "q2": "What happens after the trial period?",
      "a2": "After the free week, you can choose one of the three plans (Solo, Team or Enterprise). There's no automatic upgrade to a paid plan. If you don't choose a plan, your access is paused — but your data is kept for 30 days in case you decide later.",
      "q3": "Can I cancel anytime?",
      "a3": "Yes, you can cancel anytime — no minimum term and no hidden costs. For monthly billing, cancellation takes effect at the end of the current month. For annual billing, at the end of the booked term. You keep full access to all features until then.",
      "q4": "Is there a discount for annual payment?",
      "a4": "Yes, with annual payment you save 10% compared to monthly billing. You can switch between monthly and annual billing at any time. The change takes effect at the next billing period.",
      "q5": "What is a 'Seat' and how does it work?",
      "a5": "A Seat is a user account for a member of your team. Solo includes 1 Seat (ideal for individual agents), Team includes 5 Seats (perfect for small to medium offices). Need more than 5 Seats? Then the Enterprise plan is right for you — contact us for a custom quote.",
      "q6": "What payment methods are accepted?",
      "a6": "Payment processing is handled securely by Stripe, one of the world's leading payment providers. We accept credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex), SEPA direct debit and invoicing. All payment data is encrypted and processed directly by Stripe — we never have access to your card details.",
      "q7": "Can I switch between plans?",
      "a7": "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. When upgrading, the new price is prorated. When downgrading, the change takes effect at the next billing period.",
      "q8": "Is there a setup fee?",
      "a8": "No. There are no setup fees, no onboarding costs and no hidden charges. You only pay the monthly or annual price of your chosen plan.",
      "q9": "Is Immivo GDPR-compliant?",
      "a9": "Yes, fully. We host all data on AWS EU (Frankfurt). All data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS/HTTPS). Each customer has their own isolated data space (multi-tenancy). There is no third-party tracking.",
      "q10": "What's included in the free version?",
      "a10": "In the free trial, you have access to all basic features: CRM, lead management, properties, email integration and calendar. Jarvis AI assistant and the AI Image Studio have limited availability. Portal push (publishing to real estate portals) is not available in the free version."
